This will give us the latest price change for each product before or on the given date.\n3. We left join the Products table again (aliased as c2) with the same conditions as the previous join, but we add an additional condition to check if there is any price change after the one we got from the first join and before or on '2019-08-16'. If there is no such row, it means the price we got from the first join is the latest price for that product on the given date.\n4. We use COALESCE to replace any NULL values (i.e., products with no price change) with the default price of 10.\n5. Finally, we select the product_id and the corresponding price.\"\n}"
